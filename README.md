# Processing-Life-Entropy-Simulator
This is a evolutionary-ish simulator written in Java/Processing.

# Note

You should customize the path in /WorldMap.pde for your own needs.

When exporting the application, don't forget to set boolean deploy at /WorldMap.pde to true.

Reproduction is ready to push into the main program (all the functions are there) but implementation has not happened yet. (Not planned, development is indefinitely stopped).
